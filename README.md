## Overview

The community of Sekolah Tinggi Teknologi Terpadu Nurul Fikri (STT-NF) continues to grow along with the increasing number of students and alumni; however, internal communication still faces challenges. Platforms such as Telegram groups and websites have not been effective in reaching all members, especially in terms of interaction across departments and academic cohorts. On the other hand, the high usage of smartphones in Indonesia presents an opportunity to build a mobile-based community platform. This research designs an Android-based mobile community application developed using the Design Thinking approach and the Extreme Programming methodology. The application features onboarding, forums, notifications, search, news, and profile management, and is integrated with Firebase. Black-box testing showed that all 59 test scenarios ran successfully. Usability testing with 12 usersâ€“consisting of seven students and five alumniâ€“also indicated positive responses, particularly toward the forum, search, and notification features. With a total of 101 positive responses out of 108 received across the nine available features, this application is expected to serve as an integrated communication solution and a foundation for future development of a unified STT-NF system.

Nufian Connect is a community-based mobile application that aims to solve problems in communications and informations faced by students and alumni alike. This app is based on Kotlin and uses Firebase backend services.

## Demo

Due to privacy reasons and limited database quota, currently there are no build available for public yet. 

## Future plans (priorities based on the list)

+ Allowing publics to access using a restricted account that only allows them to access certain posts and features.
+ Under the recommendation of STT Terpadu Nurul Fikri's Rector, Dr. Lukman Rosyidi, S.T., M.M., M.T. and my Thesis Supervisor, Ahmad Rio Adriansyah, S.Si. M.Si., this app is planned to be integrated to the campus online systems and released on Google Play Store
+ Adding much more features such as chats (WIP), Near me locator for users, search based on categories and so on.
